# Pack package interfaces
The Pack package function interfaces description.

## Introduction
Pack package is a functional package. It can encrypt files or data and generate check code with various algorithms. Related algorithms are mainly from the Go package.

## Feature of package
The package has two kinds of feature, one is pack or encrypt files or data to protect files or data security, the other is generate check code so that we can use this function to realize check function.

#### Pack or Encrypt files or data protect its security
  * Can pack or encrypt any type of files or data.
  * Support encrypt various algorithms, like AES, DES, 3DES, RSA, BASE64, etc.
  * Support HTTP and HTTPS to call this function.
  * You can know the process when pack or encrypt.
  * Simple and useful.
